# Abstract

*Cultural diversity is a complex and multi-faceted concept. Commonly used
quantitative measures of the spatial distribution of culturally-defined groups
– such as segregation, isolation or concentration indexes – have been designed
to capture just one feature of this distribution. The strengths and weaknesses
of such measures under varying demographic, geographic and behavioral
conditions can only be comprehensively assessed empirically. This has been
rarely done in the case of multigroup cultural diversity. This paper aims to
fill this gap and to provide evidence on the empirical properties of various
segregation indexes by means of Monte Carlo replications of agent-based
modelling (MC-ABM) simulations under widely varying assumptions. Schelling’s
classical segregation model is used as the theoretical engine to generate
patterns of spatial clustering. The data inputs include the initial
population, the assumed geography, the number and shares of various cultural
groups, and their preferences with respect to co-location. Our MC-ABM data
generating process produces output maps that enable us to assess the
sensitivity of the various measures of segregation to parameter assumptions by
means of response surface analysis. We find that, as our simulated city
becomes more diverse, stable residential location equilibria require the
preference for co-location with one’s own group to be not much more than the
group share of the smallest demographic minority. When equilibria exist, the
values of the various segregation measures are strongly dependent on the
composition of the population across cultural groups, the assumed preferences
and the assumed geography. Index values are generally non- decreasing in
increasing preference for within-group co-location. More diverse populations
yield – for given preferences and geography – a greater degree of spatial
clustering. The sensitivity of segregation measures to underlying conditions
suggests that meaningful analysis of the impact of segregation requires
spatial panel data modelling.*
