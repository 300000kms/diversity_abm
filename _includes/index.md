This website contains the code and data used to run the simulations underlying
the paper results, as well as those to create the visualizations included,
plus some additional ones not reported in the paper. [Code](code.html)
contains the code written for the paper, as well as instructions to run it on
your own. [Visualizations](vis.html) contains the figures in the paper, as
well as some that were not included in the paper but are of interest, and code
to produce all of them.
