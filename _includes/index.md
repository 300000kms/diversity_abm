[Astract here]

This website contains the code and data used to run the simulations underlying
the paper results, as well as those to create the visualizations included,
plus some additional ones not reported in the paper. 

[Structure of the website]

required to reproduce the figures in
the paper, along with some light explanation of the main insights and
techniques that came out of this project. [Data
Preparation](data_prep.html) contains a description of the data used and STATA code
to process it into the shape and form we need it for the visualization,
including how to run the regressions for the Roback model on which we rely.
[Visualizations](results.html) contains Python code to reproduce the figures
presented in the paper. More importantly, the code is flexible and general
enough that allows any user with basic Python skills to adapt it to different
datasets or new questions.

# Distribution

This **website** is hosted in an open repository that contains both the website
itself as well as the code and data required to reproduce figures and results
in the paper. You can access its contents in the following two options:

* Online version ([html](http://darribas.org/belts)).
* Github repository ([link](https://github.com/darribas/belts)).

**Code and data** can be downloaded separately from he Github repository. Either
via the standard `git` workflow (`clone` or `fork`) or as a compressed file
([link](https://github.com/darribas/belts/archive/code_data.zip)).
